## Periphera
Simple web application for web programming course's assignment (currently in progress)


### How to use 
Using XAMPP
- Clone this repo onto your document root directory
- Import the `periphera_db.sql` file into your database first
- Then start the web app by entering `localhost/periphera` on your browser
- Hopefully some page with a simple HOMEPAGE text will appear on your browser
- If you are gonna deploy this on some server, make sure to change the `<base>` tag with your preferred base dir, I haven't done it yet so no further instruction on that (maybe later xD)
