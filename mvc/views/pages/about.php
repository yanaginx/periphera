    <h3 class="text-center">The idea</h3>
    <p class="text-center">
      Jewellery is an object of permanence, something that transcends the boundaries of age and time and that can be passed on from one generation to another.
    </p>
    <p class='text-center'>
      Founded by us, the Periphera company, the manager addresses the need to communicate directly with their clientele and to disrupt the old impersonal system. It is built to offer jewelry that is not just a family heirloom that may gather dust in bank vaults for the most part of its life but a beautiful object of adornment that echoes the sentiments and emotions of the wearer.

    <h3 class="text-center">The meaning</h3>
    <p class="text-center">
      The meaning of true luxury is not about how much we own, it's about how well we live. To live well, we need certainty and assurance and that comes with owning meaningful products. A true testament to that idea of discreet luxury and beauty in Indian jewelry made timeless with an edge of refinement.

      Periphera's design portfolio ranges from the simpler timeless designs to layered one-of-a-kind masterpieces, created in partnership with skilled artisans, helping revive the techniques which are fast getting extinct as popular design preferences take precedence. Always making sure the slight imperfections and quirks that truly make a piece unique are not just preserved but celebrated, ensure luxury and quality with a hawk-eyed attention to detail.
